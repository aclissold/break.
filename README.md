break.

Stop typing and give your hands a rest. It’s too easy to get completely absorbed
in what you’re doing—a simple break reminder can make all the difference.

Set alerts to repeat as frequently as you want them. Or go off the grid and
silence them completely.

And with Apple Watch, the notifications come straight to your wrist. Snooze them
if you’re just finishing up what you’re doing, or check the Glance to plan for
your next `break.`
